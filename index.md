# About Me

I am a graduate student pursuing an MS in Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona. My background in Spanish language and education has uniquely prepared me for work in computational linguistics and natural language processing. After earning my BA in Spanish, I spent several years teaching Spanish and English abroad in Southern Chile and Valencia, Spain. These experiences working with language learners and navigating cross-cultural communication sparked my interest in how computers can process, understand, and generate human language. This passion led me to transition into the HLT field, where I now apply computational methods to solve real-world language problems.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed strong technical skills in Python programming and natural language processing. I am proficient in key NLP libraries and frameworks including spaCy, NLTK, transformers, and sentence-transformers. My expertise extends to building production-ready systems using FastAPI for backend development and Streamlit for creating user-friendly interfaces. I have hands-on experience with modern NLP techniques including semantic search, vector embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Additionally, I have worked extensively with ChromaDB for vector storage, LangChain for building LLM applications, and have experience leveraging high-performance computing resources for large-scale transcription tasks using OpenAI's Whisper model. I'm comfortable working with the full NLP pipeline—from data collection and preprocessing through model deployment and system integration.

During my time in the MS HLT program, I have gained valuable practical experience through coursework and a professional internship. At Epistemix, I developed a comprehensive RAG system for searching and answering questions about podcast transcripts, implementing the complete pipeline from audio transcription through semantic search and LLM-powered question answering. This project involved transcribing 24 podcast episodes, building an intelligent chunking system, generating embeddings for nearly 1,000 text segments, and creating both API and web interfaces for user interaction. In my coursework, particularly LING 508, I built a yoga pose recommendation system that allows users to find appropriate poses based on targeted body areas, demonstrating my ability to design and implement full-stack applications that bridge databases, backend logic, and user interfaces.

My professional interests center on practical applications of NLP that solve real-world problems, particularly in information retrieval, question answering, and building accessible tools that make complex information more discoverable. Looking forward, I aim to contribute to projects that leverage large language models and semantic search to improve how people access and interact with information. I am excited to apply my unique combination of language teaching experience and technical NLP skills to create systems that truly understand and serve user needs.
