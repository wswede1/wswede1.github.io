# Introduction

I am a graduate student at the University of Arizona pursuing an MS in Human Language Technology (HLT), as well as a full-time Spanish teacher. After earning my BA in Spanish from the University of Pittsburgh (H2P!), I spent several years teaching both Spanish and English. I've worked in public schools in Southern Chile, Spain, and middle and high schools in Northern Virginia. I also served as a graduate teaching assistant at both George Mason University and the University of Arizona.

After seven years in the classroom, I decided to pivot toward technology and accepted a position in Data Curation at a small startup. My responsibilities began with data annotation for traditional machine learning models, and I eventually expanded into designing tasks and tools for the company's enterprise-grade flagship AI agent. This role immersed me in the rapidly evolving world of large language models, where I performed quality assurance on model outputs and served as the human-in-the-loop for model refinement. This hands-on experience with cutting-edge NLP systems and observing their capabilities and limitations firsthand sparked my interest in formally studying Human Language Technology.

As I complete the HLT program at the University of Arizona, I have returned to the classroom to teach Spanish at a local middle school. This position allows me to share my enthusiasm for language while also educating the next generation (and co-workers) about responsible AI usage. My technical training in HLT at the UofA and my experience working directly with these systems in industry have given me a deep appreciation for how people interact with these technologies.

## HLT Experience

During my time in the MS HLT program, I have gained valuable practical experience through coursework and a professional internship. For my internship, I worked on a RAG system for Epistemix, a tech startup based in Pittsburgh, PA. Epistemix is a simulation and predictive analytics company that builds agent-based models and synthetic populations to help organizations make confident decisions in uncertain scenarios. Their work informs strategic planning in areas like precision public health, consumer behavior, and resource allocation by modeling complex population dynamics. The intention for the RAG system was to allow users to search and answer questions about the company, further promote their mission, and evangelize their methods and insights. The data used in this project came from the company podcast, "The Flux."

Another project I particularly enjoyed during my time in the HLT program was a yoga pose recommendation system that allows users to find appropriate poses based on targeted body areas.

## Career Goals

My professional interests center on practical applications of NLP that solve real-world problems, particularly in education. Technology has provided countless educational opportunities to people all across the globe, and I look forward to making a meaningful contribution to that effort.

When I'm not teaching or reading the latest research, I spend my time obsessing over the perfect home-cooked meal, doing yoga, and exploring local trails with my dog.
