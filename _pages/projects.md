# Featured Projects

Below are examples of my work during the Human Language Technology program at the University of Arizona.

## Internship Project

**Organization:** Epistemix  
**Duration:** Summer/Fall 2025
**Role:** NLP Intern

### Overview
I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for "The Flux", Epistemix's company podcast, that enables semantic search over podcast transcripts and provides answers with precise timecode citations. The system makes hours of audio content easily searchable by transcribing episodes with Whisper, building an intelligent chunking system that preserves boundaries, and generating embeddings stored in a ChromaDB vector database. The final deliverable includes a REST API backend and web interface built with FastAPI and Streamlit that allows users to search conversations and get LLM-generated answers with citations.

**Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, ChromaDB, LangChain, OpenAI Whisper, Ollama, BGE-M3 embeddings

## LING 508 Course Project

**Course:** LING 508 – Computational Techniques for Linguists  
**Semester:** Summer 2024  
**Focus:** Web APIs, Database Design, Information Retrieval

### Overview
YogaDB is a full-stack yoga pose finder that helps people find poses based on the body parts they want to target. I built a Flask application with a MySQL database containing 100 yoga poses, each with English and Sanskrit names, pose types, target body parts, and step-by-step instructions. The web interface uses server-side rendering with Jinja2 templates and Bootstrap, allowing users to search with either a dropdown menu or custom keywords to find relevant poses.

**Technologies Used:** Python 3.11, Flask, MySQL 8, Bootstrap 5, Docker, Pytest
