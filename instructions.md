HLT Internship professional website rubric

Professional website option: students may choose to prepare a professional website describing their internship work as well as relevant course-related work or even personal projects, for an audience that includes hiring managers as well as other technology workers. The goal is for students to provide a clear and adequately-documented presentation of code and other content that demonstrates their NLP skills, including the content of their internship and its learning outcomes.
Here are some examples of professional websites created by HLT students:
https://kelynnski.github.io/ : Kelynn Nowakowski
https://pbarrett520.github.io/ : Patrick Barrett
https://mc-wut.github.io/ : Matt Evans-McLaughlin
https://weezymatt.github.io/ : Matthew Hernandez
https://acooke82.github.io/ : Alexandra Cooke
Examples of professional websites of this type that have been created by NLP professionals are listed below. These examples may not meet all the requirements listed here, but they are intended as a guide to what is possible, while students must tailor their own website to meet the requirements of the HLT program.
maelfabien.github.io/portfolio: Maël Fabien, portfolio and projects
DataDan.IO: Daniel Whitenack, a data scientist creating AI for good
chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/: Chris Tran
snknitin.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2/ : Nitin Kishore Sai Samala
likarajo.github.io/Projects/portfolio/ : Rajarshi Chattopadhyay
Rubric and evaluation criteria
For the purposes of the UAZHLT program, this website should include:
a professional introduction to the student of between 300 to 1000 words, focusing on professional background and skills (personal/non-professional interests are not prohibited, but should not be the focus)
an updated copy of the student’s resume or CV; the choice of resume or CV is up to the student, based on the kind of jobs that are in focus. (What makes a CV and a resume different?)
Descriptions and relevant supporting information for at least two projects that the student has contributed to. One of these projects will be the internship itself. The student’s course project from LING 508 (especially for students who have taken the online version of LING 508) would be a good candidate for a second project to present on the site. Additional projects may be included from other courses or from work outside of courses; only two projects will be required and evaluated as part of this degree requirement. Each project description will include:
Project summary: A summary of the project goals, technology used, and outcomes, as appropriate for a general technical audience, of between 1000 and 3000 words. It should answer questions including
What did you do in this project? 
What was the goal, and how did you plan to achieve it? 
What problems did you encounter, and how did you solve them? 
What libraries or tools did you use? 
What were you able to apply from past courses? What did you have to learn that was specific to this project?
What was the state at the completion of the project? Are there future plans for what your internship host will do with your contributions, or with this project more generally?
Project or work descriptions in excess of 3000 words total are not prohibited, but if you choose to write a more detailed description of a project that exceeds 3000 words in all, you must still include a 1000 to 3000 word summary.
Learning goals: The project summary should clearly communicate how the student’s experience in the project demonstrated the learning outcomes for the MS in HLT program. These learning outcomes are that the student will:

Write, debug, and document readable and efficient code in programming languages commonly used to develop, implement, and evaluate HLT models, as demonstrated through course projects and a professional internship.
Select and apply appropriate algorithms and core concepts in HLT to perform common tasks and solve realistic problems, as demonstrated through course projects and a professional internship.
Apply common tools and libraries used in HLT by integrating them into course projects and real-world applications or workflows, as demonstrated through course projects and a professional internship.
Demonstrate professional skills in the field of HLT, including effective teamwork, clear and concise communication, professional networking, understanding of business procedures and team-based code development, leadership, and critical thinking, as demonstrated through course presentations, projects, and a professional internship.
Actual code you wrote: The description of each project should include the actual code that was developed by the student for the project or that supported the project. This can be in the form of code snippets interleaved in the description (code snippets will not count against the 1000-3000 word target) or, if the amount of code is large or complex, a link to where this code can be accessed, such as a GitHub repository. If the function of the code is best illustrated with data, make sure to include some; if the actual data that you used cannot be shared, then provide some representative “toy” data. If the full code cannot be shared, then at a minimum, relevant and illustrative code snippets should be shared; another alternative is to share the documentation of the code where the code itself cannot be. Alternative considerations are discussed below.

The descriptions of the internship and the student’s second project should adequately demonstrate that they were carried out with the attention to quality that we hope to maintain for our program. The faculty evaluators will provide appropriate feedback to students where this is not the case.
Although the demonstration of skills and code is an important part of this website, the site is also a reflection of the professionalism of the student. For this reason, there should be no grammatical, mechanical, or stylistic issues that detract from the professionalism of the site.
Since this website is intended to benefit students as a personal job-seeking tool, students are welcome, but not required, to include additional components that they feel will better present them and their work in a hiring context. These may include documentation and description of additional programming projects, or prose-only reflections on HLT tools, libraries, models, or approaches (ie, like traditional blog entries). These may be sourced from course assignments or may be written independently of courses.
