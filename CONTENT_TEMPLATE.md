## Tips for Effective Writing

### Be Specific
❌ "I used machine learning to classify text"
✅ "I implemented a BERT-based classifier using the Hugging Face transformers library, fine-tuning the bert-base-uncased model on 5,000 labeled examples to achieve 87% accuracy on sentiment classification"

### Show Process
❌ "I solved the data processing problem"
✅ "The raw data contained inconsistent encodings and malformed JSON. I wrote a preprocessing pipeline that validated encoding, handled exceptions, and standardized the format, reducing errors from 15% to less than 1%"

### Include Numbers
❌ "The system was faster"
✅ "The optimized system processed documents in 0.3 seconds compared to 4.2 seconds with the baseline approach—a 14x speedup"

### Demonstrate Learning
❌ "I learned about transformers"
✅ "While I understood transformer architectures conceptually from LING 539, implementing attention mechanisms myself revealed the importance of positional encodings in maintaining word order—something I initially overlooked when debugging my model's poor performance"

### Connect to Outcomes
❌ "I wrote code for preprocessing"
✅ "I wrote a robust preprocessing module that standardized inconsistent formatting across 50,000 documents. This preprocessing step proved essential—without it, model accuracy was 62%, but with proper preprocessing, accuracy increased to 84%"

## Word Count Guidelines

**Professional Introduction:**
- Minimum: 300 words (about 2 solid paragraphs)
- Target: 500-700 words (sweet spot)
- Maximum: 1000 words

**Each Project Description:**
- Minimum: 1000 words (about 3-4 pages)
- Target: 1500-2000 words (demonstrates thoroughness)
- Maximum: 3000 words
- Note: Code snippets DON'T count toward word count

**CV/Resume:**
- No specific word count, but should be comprehensive
- 1-2 pages is typical for resume
- CV can be longer with full course listings

## Checking Your Work

### Before You Submit
- [ ] Run spell check
- [ ] Use Grammarly or similar
- [ ] Read aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
- [ ] Check all links work
- [ ] Verify word counts
- [ ] Ask someone to read it
- [ ] Check against rubric
- [ ] Sleep on it and review again

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Vague descriptions without specifics
- Not enough code examples
- Not explicitly addressing learning outcomes
- Too focused on what the project was, not enough on what YOU did
- Grammatical errors
- Inconsistent tense (pick past tense for completed projects)
- Missing quantitative results
- Not explaining WHY you made technical choices

Good luck! Remember, this portfolio represents you professionally—invest the time to make it excellent.
